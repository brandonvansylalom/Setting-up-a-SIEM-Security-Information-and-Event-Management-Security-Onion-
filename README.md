# Setting-up-a-SIEM-Security-Information-and-Event-Management-Security-Onion-

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a project/lab aimed at installing Security Onion as a network security monitoring and SIEM platform in a virtual environment, configure basic networking, and prepare it for use in monitoring and hunting operations. The goal is to be able to understand how SIEMs work and get hands-on work with open source tools within a virtualized environment.

📌 1. Preparation & Environment Setup

Download the Security Onion ISO

Visit the official SO download page and download the latest ISO image.

Verify the image integrity (checksum) if needed before use.

Choose Your Virtualization Platform

Use VMware Workstation/Player, VirtualBox, Proxmox, or any hypervisor you prefer.

Ensure the host has adequate resources (CPU cores, RAM, and disk) to support Security Onion.

Create a New Virtual Machine for Security Onion

Name: e.g., Security Onion 2.4

Type: Linux | Version: Oracle Linux 9.x or Other Linux 64-bit

Attach the ISO: Mount the downloaded Security Onion ISO to the new VM’s CD drive.

Hardware:

CPU: 2+ cores (4+ recommended for heavy use)

RAM: 8 GB minimum (12 GB+ recommended)

Disk: 50 GB+ (200 GB+ ideal for logs/analysis depending on data retention needs)

Networking:

NIC1: NAT or Bridged (management interface with IP)

NIC2: “sniffer” or secondary interface for network monitoring if needed (SPAN/TAP)

🛠️ 2. Installing the Operating System

Power On the VM

Boot from ISO and wait for the initial Security Onion installer menu.

Start Installation

When prompted, select Install Security Onion (the installer will be automatically invoked).

Follow the on-screen guided installer:

Choose Language, Keyboard Layout, and other regional settings.

Partition disks (default is usually acceptable).

Enter a username and password for the admin account.

Complete OS Installation

Allow the installer to copy files and configure the base system.

Once complete, reboot the VM.

Remove the ISO if the system doesn’t automatically eject it after install.

⚙️ 3. Initial Configuration (so-setup)

After the initial reboot, Security Onion Setup will launch automatically. If not, you can manually start it:

sudo so-setup

During the Setup Wizard:

Deployment Type

Choose either Standalone (all-in-one) or a distributed deployment with manager/search nodes.

For a lab or evaluation, a Standalone install is typical.

Network Configuration

Assign the management interface (with an IP).

If present, select the second interface as a sniffer (this interface usually will not have an IP).

Confirm the IP, gateway, and DNS settings.

Host and Domain

Assign a hostname (e.g., sec-onion-lab).

Optionally add a domain if applicable to your environment.

Services & Use Case

Choose features to enable (analytics, alerts, dashboards, etc.).

Set whether this node is manager, search, sensor, or all-in-one.

Finalize

Review choices and confirm.

Setup will install and configure security services, generate certificates, and prepare dashboards.

Important: The hostname you set during this step is used to generate certificates and should not be changed later once setup is complete.

🌐 4. Post-Install Access & Verification

Login to the System

After installation, log in via the console using your admin credentials.

Validate Services

Confirm that core services are running:

sudo so-status


This verifies that key components (suricata, elastic, kibana, etc.) are up.

Web Interface

From a browser on another machine, access the Security Onion web UI at the management IP:
https://<your-manager-ip>

You should see dashboards, alerts, and search interfaces.

🔧 5. Allow Analyst & Client Access (so-allow)

Use the built-in utility to allow analyst IP(s) to interact with the manager:

sudo so-allow


Choose Analyst Role

Enter the IP or subnet of the machine you will use for browser access.

This creates firewall rules permitting that access.

🧰 6. Confirm Monitoring & Data Flow

Verify Dashboards

You should see initial data feeds if any traffic has been captured.

Test Alerts

Generate or import test traffic (e.g., via PCAP) to confirm IDS signatures trigger alerts.

Confirm visibility in Alerts, Dashboards, and other panels.
